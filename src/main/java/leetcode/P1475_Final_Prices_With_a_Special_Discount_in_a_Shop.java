    /**
     * You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.
     * <p>
     * There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive
     * a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i].
     * Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.
     * <p>
     * Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop,
     * considering the special discount.
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
     * Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
     * Explanation:
     * For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore,
     * the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
     * For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore,
     * the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
     * For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore,
     * the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
     * For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
     * <p>
     * Example 2:
     * Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
     * Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
     * Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
     * <p>
     * Example 3:
     * Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
     * Output: [9,0,1,6]
